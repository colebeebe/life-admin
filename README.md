# Overview

At this point in time, I'm still relatively new to JavaScript. The goal of this project was to continue researching and understanding how to manipulate the DOM and other things using JavaScript in tandem with HTML and CSS.

This project was written entirely with vim.

While creating the project, I hoped to better learn the relationship between JavaScript and HTML/CSS, and how things can be dynamically added to a webpage.

# Development Environment

To write this project, I used nvim set up with LSP servers for the various languages. When it came to version control I used git's CLI. The project can be viewed by opening any of the HTML files in the browser of your choice. The browser I used during development was Arc.

This project was written without any external libraries.

# Future Work

There are many things to improve in the future, some of which are as follows:

- CRUD integration; allow the user to edit and delete the posted items
- Saving. Currently, everything is lost on refresh (or when navigating to another page)
- JavaScript refactoring
- Minor graphical inconsistencies/glitches (things like misalignments)
- Display number of todos left on homepage
- Order todos by date
- Put finished todos on bottom of page
